🧬 **What I'm Exploring Right Now**
- 🔬 Stem cells & regenerative medicine
- 🧠 AI & tissue modeling for personalized healthcare
- 📉 Biomechanics & human injury prevention
- 🧪 Applying MATLAB and Java in bioengineering projects

---

🧰 **Tools & Languages I'm Learning**
- 💻 MATLAB, Java, Python
- 📊 Simulink, Control Toolbox
- 📁 Git & GitHub (This profile is my learning canvas!)

---

🧠 **Projects & Work in Progress**
- `cryo-stem-revival`: Research notes + future simulation on stem cell viability after cryopreservation
- `biomechanics-ai-sim`: Exploring AI use in injury prediction and recovery
- `smart-scaffolds-iot`: Concepts for smart, remote-sensing implants
